### Introduction
Design patterns for object orientated programs are divided into three broad categories listed below. 
These are the same categories used by GoF in their seminal work on design patterns.

1. Creational
2. Structural
3. Behavioural

### Creational
Creational design patterns relate to how objects are constructed from classes. New-ing up objects may sound 
trivial but unthoughtfully littering code with object instance creations can lead to headaches down the road.
The creational design pattern come with powerful suggestions on how best to encapsulate object creation process in a program.



1. Builder Pattern
2. Prototype Pattern
3. Singleton Pattern
4. Abstract Factory Pattern


### Structural
Structural patterns are concerned with the composition of classes i.e. how the classes are made up or constructed. 
These include:

1. Adapter Pattern
2. Bridge Pattern
3. Composite Pattern
4. Decorator Pattern
5. Facade Pattern
6. Flyweight Pattern
7. Proxy Pattern


#### Behavioral
Behavioral design patterns dictate the interaction of classes and objects amongst eachother and the delegation
of responsibility. These include:

1. Interpreter Pattern
2. Template Pattern
3. Chain of Responsibility Pattern
4. Command Pattern
5. Iterator Pattern
6. Mediator Pattern
7. Memento Pattern
8. Observer Pattern
9. State Pattern
10. Strategy Pattern
11. Visitor Pattern


### For Interview Prep
For folks, who are rushing through the course for an upcoming interview, I would suggest going through all 
the ***creational design patterns, decorator, proxy, iterator, observer and visitor patterns***. As you read
through them, be sure to look at the Java framework's api examples pointed out in each lesson.
